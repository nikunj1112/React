## 💡 Implementation Highlights

* **Custom Hooks:** Effective use of `useEffect` and `useState` for component lifecycle and state management.
* **Unique Chat ID:** A stable `docId` is generated by sorting sender and receiver emails to maintain a single, consistent chat history in Firestore.
* **Optimistic UI:** Local Redux updates (`editLocalMessage`, `updateLocalStatus`) provide immediate user feedback before the backend database confirms the changes.
